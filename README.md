Note:
1. Ensure no spaces and special character between or before URLs in the input.
2. Reloading the page will remove all the existing data in the URL table. However, you can easily access short url from long url and vice-versa by re-entering the same in input fields.
3. For accurate click results, please refresh the page and enter same url. Clicks will get updated.

Thank you. It was fun :)
